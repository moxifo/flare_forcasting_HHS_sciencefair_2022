# This script is a good place for your visualization methods.

# TODO: for each visualization you should have one method. If there are
#  snipets of code that would be repeated in each method, take them out and
#  create separate methods for them as well. So, most of your code that is
#  now in `main.py` should be moved here, but they all should go in methods.

#  No snipet of code should wander around outside a method.
