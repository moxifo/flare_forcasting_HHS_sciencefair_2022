# flare_forcasting_HHS_sciencefair_2022
Solar Flares are explosions of intense radiation coming from the release of magnetic energy associated with sunspots. 
Solar Flares can cause problems from communication disruptions to transformer explosions. 
Thus, it is necessary to predict these solar flares in order to prepare for the damage they will cause. 

	Machine Learning is the use of computer algorithms that can learn from previous data to make inferences. 
  This project will be using a Decision Tree Classifier, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm 
  (models that model relationships between independent and dependent variable to predict new values based on different data). 
  The classification algorithm will generate a subsequent Decision Tree to classify data. 
  The decision tree consists of leaves which are the nodes that store Boolean statements the model uses to classify data. 
	A Confusion Matrix will be used to measure the model’s performance. Figure 2 displays an example of a confusion matrix.
  In datasets where the dependent variable is a true/false statement, then a confusion matrix can be helpful to get an overall view of the model’s performance.
  The True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) values represent the correctly predicted false and true values.
  I.e.) If a solar flare occurred or not, the False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) values represent the incorrectly predicted false and true values. 
  From this confusion matrix, the F1-score can be derived. F1-score is a metric which provides a broader view of performance compared to accuracy.
